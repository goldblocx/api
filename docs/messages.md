# Messaging Concept

Messaging is a part of the System which allows users to communicate with the service
provider. Currently, we support communication (in the form of a chat) with the
technical support.

# Getting the Number of Unread Messages

### REQUEST:

```
GET    /api/v1/messages/counter
```

```bash      
curl -X GET -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
             $API_HOST/api/v1/messages/counter
```

### RESPONSE:

```json
2
```

It is just a number which depicts the number of messages which are unread yet.
After performing the [retrieve](#Retrieving Messages) operation by a customer,
the number of unread will be reset to zero for this customer.

# Retrieving Messages

This operation returns a list with messages for the current customer. Customers
have their own list of messages (or one conversation per customer).

### REQUEST:

```
GET    /api/v1/messages
```

### ARGUMENTS:

- **page** - the number of page to load
- **per_page** - how many items should be on the page

```bash
curl -X GET -H "Accept: application/json" \
            -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" $API_HOST/api/v1/messages?page=0&per_page=10
```

### RESPONSE:

```json

  "code": 0 ,
  "messages": [
    {
      "attachments": [
        {
          ...

# Submitting Messages

The operation submits a text message with possibly attached files. The identifiers of the files should be
specified in the "attachments" field and preliminarily uploaded (see uploading files below).

### REQUEST:

```
   POST   /api/v1/messages
```

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
             -d {"message" : "Some text", "attachments":[{"id" : 31952}]} \
             $API_HOST/api/v1/messages
```

### EXAMPLE of RESPONSE:

```json
{
  "attachments": [
    {
      ...
    } ,
    ...
  ] ,
  "code": 0 ,
  "date": "2020-07-21T15:52:38.940+0000" ,
  "direction": "OUT" ,
