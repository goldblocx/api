# WebSocket Support

We use WebSocket to send instant notifications to the user.

In order to start a new websocket session you need to query a JWT token from
an authenticated session. It means that you must complete the authentication before
(please refer to [the authentication section](../authentication.md)).

You can request a new JWT token:

```bash
curl -X GET -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
             $AUTH_HOST/auth/api/v1/jwt
```

The result will be something like that:
"

This JWT token can be used to create new subscriptions on the websocket server.
Let's denote the websocket as $WS_HOST variable.

* For the test stage, **https://ws.test.goldblocx.com/ws**
* for the production: **https://ws.goldblocx.com/ws**

After establishing a new connection to the websocket server, you can subscribe on some topics providing
the JWT token in the 'jwt' header.

Currently, we support the following topics:

1. `/auth/topic/events` for common messages that are related to the authenticated user
2. `/exchange/exchange.rate` for notification on changed exchange rates.
