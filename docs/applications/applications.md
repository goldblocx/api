# Application Concept

Applications are a way to build your own services using the platform and its abilities to store and to carry out
financial transactions using different electronic assets including those you create for your own aims.

1. [Creating a new application](#creating-new-application)
2. [Removing an Application](#removing-application)
3. [Modifying an Application](#modifying-applications)
4. [Obtaining Application Details](#obtaining-application-details)
5. [Obtaining All Applications](#obtaining-all-applications)
6. [Obtaining the Application of a Provider](#obtaining-by-provider)


You can see some examples for these operations: [application_test](../../tests/applications_test.sh).


# Creating New Application

This operation allows you to create an application and to receive app\_id and app\_secret from the server which can be
used in the OAUTH2 [authentication procedure](../authentication.md).

**To perform the creation you need to be logged in as a corporate customer.** 


### REQUEST:

```
POST /api/v1/applications 
```

### ARGUMENTS:

```
   {"redirects" : ["http://localhost:8080/login"], "provider": {"id": 1234567} }
```
    (optional) The 'redirects' array must be filled with an url in the case when you use the web authorization flow and you need to
    provide a callback url to make a redirection from the authorization server back to your application.
    
    (optional) The 'provider' is a reference to [the provider object](../models/provider.md). This field is used
    when you need to link the application to the same provider as some other application has. If the applications
    have the same provider, they may have same settings like fees. 

### EXAMPLE

```bash
MODEL='{"redirects" : ["http://localhost:8080"] }'

curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" $API_HOST/api/v1/applications -d $MODEL
```

### RESPONSE:

```javascript
  {
    "code":0,
    "created":"2016-04-03T14:06:58.620+0000",
    "app_id":"3a16d63129c94e7d93b0d0bb6a898691",
    "app_secret":"18fa73f6ab8c45779c1c66de6a6ede1d",
    "grant_types":["authorization_code","password","refresh_token"],
    "redirects":["http://localhost:8080"]
  }
```

Now, you can provide for your clients the ability to login via your own application using the given app\_id and app\_secret.
See, for example, [this test](../../tests/applications_test.sh)

Additional information on the application object can be found [here](../models/application.md)


# Removing Application

Removes the specified application.

### REQUEST:
```
    DELETE /api/v1/applications/:app_id
```
### ARGUMENTS:

    app_id - the identifier of the application to be removed

### EXAMPLE

```bash
APP_ID='3a16d63129c94e7d93b0d0bb6a898691'

curl -X DELETE -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" $API_HOST/api/v1/applications/$APP_ID
```

### RESPONSE:

```javascript
  {
    "code":0,
    "created":"2016-04-03T14:06:58.620+0000",
    "app_id":"3a16d63129c94e7d93b0d0bb6a898691",
    "grant_types":["authorization_code","password","refresh_token"],
    "redirects":["http://localhost:8080"]
  }
```

In the response you can see the model of the application being removed.


# Modifying Applications

You can also modify application's attributes using PUT requests with the same model as for
POST requests. The only difference is when you provide an app\_secret value in the model you can
change the application's password.

### REQUEST:
```
    PUT /api/v1/applications
```    
### ARGUMENTS:

```
    The model: { "redirects" : ["http://localhost:8080"],
                 "app_secret" : "..." }
```
    (optional) The 'redirects' array must be filled with an url in the case when you use the web authorization flow and need to
    provide a callback url to make a redirection from the authorization server back to your application.
    
    (optional) The 'app_secret' is a new password for the application. 

### EXAMPLE

```bash
MODEL='{"redirects" : ["http://localhost:8080", "https://www.com" ], "app_secret": "xxx" }'

curl -X PUT -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" $API_HOST/api/v1/applications -d $MODEL
```

### RESPONSE:

```javascript
  {
    "code":0,
    "created":"2016-04-03T14:06:58.620+0000",
    "app_id":"3a16d63129c94e7d93b0d0bb6a898691",
    "grant_types":["authorization_code","password","refresh_token"],
    "redirects":["http://localhost:8080", "https://www.com"]
  }
```

As you can mention there is no app\_secret field in the response.

# Obtaining Application Details

Returns the information about a concrete application by its identifier.

### REQUEST:
```
    GET /api/v1/applications/:app_id
```
### ARGUMENTS:

    app_id - the identifier of the application

### EXAMPLE

```bash
APP_ID='3a16d63129c94e7d93b0d0bb6a898691'
curl -X GET -H 'Accept: application/json'
            -H 'Content-Type: application/json'
            -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" $API_HOST/api/v1/applications/$APP_ID
```

### RESPONSE:

```javascript
  {
    "code":0,
    "created":"2016-04-03T14:06:58.620+0000",
    "app_id":"3a16d63129c94e7d93b0d0bb6a898691",
    "grant_types":["authorization_code","password","refresh_token"],
