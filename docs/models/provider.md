# Provider Model

The providers are the aggregates which allow to combine several application which are close to each other
from the point of the service. If you create, for instance, a loyalty point provider, you can create two
applications (e.g. web and mobile) that use the provider's loyalty points.

For more details on applications please refer to [the application section](../applications/applications.md). 

The provider's fields:

```
{
    "created": "2016-10-26T20:06:11.161+0000",
    "customer": { ... },
    "id": 1234567,
    "name": "Goldblocx"
}
```
