# Transactions

Financial transactions are the most important part of the system. They can be used
to move any kind of assets between accounts or to convert one type of asset to another.

The platform uses its own ledger for storing ledger entries of each transaction.

After completion the transaction has a special attribute 'hash' which represents
the hash value of the linked ledger transaction.

Here below, we provide a list of operations which allow to create, modify and approve
transactions of different types.
