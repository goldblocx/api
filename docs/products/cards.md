# Cards

If you use a card to replenish the balance of an account, the information about
the card is saved in the secured storage which is provided by our partner.
After storing, the card can be just used by its ID to avoid providing the whole
information about the card again.

There is a way to obtain all previously stored cards.

### REQUEST:

```
    GET /api/v1/cards
```       

### EXAMPLES:

```bash
curl -X GET -H "Accept: application/json" \
            -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" $API_HOST/api/v1/cards
```

### RESPONSE:

```json
[
  {
    "cardholder_name": "Alex Loh" ,
    "created": "2018-11-08T19:07:44.175+0000" ,
